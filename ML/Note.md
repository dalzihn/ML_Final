The folder has results of evaluation before and after hyperparameter tuning, all the data needed is in the "Data" folder, code is in the "Code" folder.

There is also a docx file that contains graph after tunining and it also contains the models before and after tuning, but because of the model is too big it is not allowed in github, I will give you a link in that docx file that takes you to the model.
